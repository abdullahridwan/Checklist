# To Do
- Done with app and currently using on my phone
- Add in Gifs on how it looks like


# Background & Notes

## Motivation
Wanted a daily todo list which helps me track the things to do every day. For example, drinking X liters of water, etc. 
I looked for an app like such at the app store but couldnt find one. Hence, I decided to make a quick version of my idea. 

## Basic Functionality
History
  - See the status (wheter you did them or not) of todo's for previous days 


## Notes
I made a prototype version of this idea in another repo. 
However, I didnt plan it out and alot of my implementation was clunky, disorganized and ineffecient (granted, I was doing it in the middle of exams ðŸ˜…).
This implementation is much more efficient and clean, and I added proper swift documentation for the functions!
